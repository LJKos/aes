# AES library

The library contains 256 bit AES chipher. The project was created for learning the AES algorithm.
The library does not utilize AES instruction set.

The project includes an example program, fileaes.c, which utilizes the library. The example program encrypts/decrypts the given file.
It removes all padding after decryption so that the file will return to its original size.
